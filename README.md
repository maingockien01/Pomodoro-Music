# Ideas
This is a simple program that will play music based on Pomodoro Interval
User can set music for working interval and sound/music for break time.
For music each interval: they can set up when create the Timer either by choosing one song repeat or shuffle 

My idea is just a console program that will run on my computer so I can start it quickly everyday
